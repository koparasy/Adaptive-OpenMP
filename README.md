# Adaptive-OpenMP

OpenMP programming model extensions which  automatically generate different code variants targeting 
different systems from a single version of source code and intelligently select and configure an 
optimal variant for a given platform.
Given the complex interactions between applications and platforms, a black-box approach 
using machine learning-driven runtime adaptation is more practical to guide the optimal 
selection and configuration of code variants, compared to 
an alternative white-box approach trying to understand internals of software and hardware. 
The resulting programming systems can significantly reduce users' efforts of programming 
on heterogeneous architectures, leveraging machine learning techniques, to achieve performance 
portability, and improve computing efficiency of HPC computing system

## Note

Currently the code is being reviewed to be released to the public.
